# Pong

Pong is one of the most well-known classic games and remains iconic to this day. It is typically a player-vs-AI game where one tries to prevent the ball from hitting their side of the screen by bouncing it off a paddle.

## Development

Currently, this is a small project I built to explore the Turtle module; it does not have the AI implemented yet so it's more for 2 players sharing a keyboard

## Future

Future additions: AI version, power-ups, points, saving max scores
